# Mobile-Controlled Car with Human Sensing Ability

### Overview

This project involves building a mobile-controlled car equipped with human sensing capabilities. The car can be remotely controlled via a mobile application, and it uses sensors to detect human presence. This can be used for various applications like security patrols, search-and-rescue operations, or home automation.

### Features

- **Mobile Control**: The car can be controlled via a smartphone through a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connection.
- **Human Detection**: Uses sensors (e.g., PIR sensor) to detect human movement and alert the user via the mobile app.
- **Obstacle Avoidance (Optional)**: The car can avoid obstacles in its path using ultrasonic or infrared sensors.
- **Real-Time Data**: Sensor data (e.g., human presence, distance) is sent in real-time to the mobile app.
- **Camera Integration (Optional)**: Optionally, the car can be equipped with a camera for live video streaming to the mobile app.

### Components

#### Hardware:
- **Microcontroller**: (e.g., Arduino, ESP32, or Raspberry Pi)
- **Motors**: DC motors with motor drivers (e.g., L298N motor driver) to control car movement.
- **Power Supply**: Battery (Li-ion or others) for powering the car and sensors.
- **PIR Sensor**: For detecting human presence.
- **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Module**: (e.g., HC-05 Bluetooth or ESP8266 Wi-Fi module) for communication with the mobile app.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor (Optional)**: For obstacle detection and avoidance.
- **Camera Module (Optional)**: (e.g., Raspberry Pi camera or webcam) for live streaming.

#### Software:
- **Mobile App**: A custom app to control the car and receive alerts. Can be developed using Flutter, React Native, or native Android/iOS platforms.
- **Microcontroller Code**: Code for controlling the car’s movement, receiving commands from the mobile app, and processing sensor data. Written in C++ for Arduino/ESP32 or Python for Raspberry Pi.
- **Communication Protocol**: Bluetooth/Wi-Fi-based communication for sending/receiving commands and sensor data.

### How It Works

1. **Mobile Control**:
   - The mobile app sends commands (forward, backward, left, right, stop) to the microcontroller via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.
   - The microcontroller processes these commands and drives the motors accordingly to control the car’s movement.

2. **Human Sensing**:
   - The PIR sensor detects motion within its field of view.
   - When human motion is detected, the sensor triggers a signal to the microcontroller.
   - The microcontroller sends a notification back to the mobile app, alerting the user of the presence of a human.

3. **Optional Features**:
   - **Obstacle Avoidance**: An ultrasonic sensor mounted on the front of the car continuously checks for obstacles. If one is detected, the car can stop or change direction automatically.
   - **Camera Integration**: The camera streams video to the mobile app, allowing the user to see the surroundings remotely in real time.

### Requirements

#### Hardware:
- Microcontroller (Arduino/ESP32/Raspberry Pi)
- Motor driver (L298N or similar)
- DC motors and wheels
- PIR sensor for human detection
- Bluetooth/Wi-Fi module (HC-05/ESP8266/ESP32)
- Power supply (Battery)
- Jumper wires, breadboard, chassis

#### Software:
- Arduino IDE or Python (if using Raspberry Pi)
- Mobile App development tools (e.g., Android Studio, Flutter, React Native)
- Bluetooth/Wi-Fi communication libraries (if applicable)

### Installation

#### Microcontroller Code:
1. Install the necessary libraries (e.g., BluetoothSerial for Arduino, Wi-Fi libraries for ESP32).
2. Upload the provided code to the microcontroller via Arduino IDE or another platform.

#### Mobile App:
1. Clone the mobile app repository (if using one) or build it from source using your preferred app development framework.
2. Pair the mobile device with the car (via Bluetooth or connect via Wi-Fi).

#### Wiring:
1. Connect the motors to the motor driver.
2. Connect the motor driver to the microcontroller.
3. Attach the PIR sensor to the microcontroller (using a digital input pin).
4. Connect the Bluetooth/Wi-Fi module to the microcontroller (TX, RX pins for Bluetooth; GPIO pins for Wi-Fi).
5. Ensure the power supply is correctly connected.

### Usage

1. **Power on** the car and ensure that the mobile device is paired with the car via Bluetooth or connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
2. Open the **mobile app** and connect to the car.
3. Use the on-screen buttons to control the car’s movement (forward, backward, left, right, stop).
4. When a human is detected by the PIR sensor, the app will display an **alert** notifying you of the detection.
5. (Optional) If the camera is enabled, you can view the live feed on the app.
6. (Optional) The car will automatically avoid obstacles if the obstacle avoidance feature is implemented.

### Schematics

1. **Motor Driver and DC Motors**:
   - Connect the motor driver inputs to the microcontroller and outputs to the motors.
   - Control pins of the motor driver will be connected to specific GPIO pins on the microcontroller.

2. **PIR Sensor**:
   - Connect the PIR sensor’s output pin to a digital pin on the microcontroller.

3. **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Module**:
   - Connect TX and RX of the Bluetooth module to the corresponding pins on the microcontroller, or connect the ESP module to the GPIO pins.

### Future Improvements

- **Path Mapping**: Implement GPS or an indoor mapping system for autonomous navigation.
- **Face Recognition**: Integrate AI for detecting specific individuals.
- **Speech Control**: Add voice command capabilities using speech recognition.
- **Enhanced App Features**: Add features like speed control, preset routes, and battery monitoring.
